                    <li>
                        Middle-level language: C combines elements of both
                        high-level languages (structured programming, functions)
                        and low-level languages (direct memory access via
                        pointers), allowing for efficient system programming.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Portability: C programs can be compiled and run on
                        different hardware platforms with minimal changes,
                        a major reason for the success of UNIX.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Structured programming: It encourages the use of
                        functions and modular code, making programs easier
                        to manage and debug.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Efficiency: C compiles to efficient machine code,
                        resulting in high-performance applications.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Foundation for other languages: Many modern languages,
                        including C++, Java, Python, and Go, have borrowed
                        syntax and concepts from C.

                <h4>
                    Due to the emergence of various versions, the American
                    National Standards Institute (ANSI) standardized the
                    language in 1989 (known as ANSI C or C89), which was
                    later adopted by the International Organization for
                    Standardization (ISO) in 1990 (C90). This ensured
                    consistency and portability across different platforms.
