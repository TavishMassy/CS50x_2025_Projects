                <h4>
                    <li>
                        Simple and Easy to Learn: Python has a straightforward,
                        English-like syntax, making it an excellent choice for
                        beginners.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Interpreted Language: Python code is executed line by
                        line at runtime, which simplifies debugging and allows
                        for rapid prototyping.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Dynamically Typed: You don't need to declare the data
                        type of a variable explicitly; the interpreter determines
                        it at runtime.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Open Source & Free: Python is freely available and has a
                        large, vibrant, community-driven ecosystem.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Extensive Standard Library: Python comes with a vast
                        collection of modules and packages, allowing developers
                        to perform various tasks without writing code from scratch
                        (a philosophy often referred to as "batteries included").
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Versatile: It supports multiple programming paradigms
                        (procedural, object-oriented, functional) and is used
                        in a wide range of applications, including web development,
                        data science, artificial intelligence, and system scripting.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Cross-Platform: Python code can run on various operating
                        systems (Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.) without requiring
                        modification.
                    </li>
